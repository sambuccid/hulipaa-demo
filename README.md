# hulipaa-demo
This is a demo of the [Hulipaa](https://github.com/sambuccid/hulipaa) library.

Go and have look at the [Website](https://sambuccid.github.io/hulipaa-demo/).

This demo generates 30000 pages with around 70 words each.  
Each page is generated using random words.

The Hulipaa library then scans through the pages and indexes all the words, so that each result is ready before even deploying the webiste.

This is why even with so many pages the search is quick and the memory footprint it low.
